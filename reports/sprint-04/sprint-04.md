##### 4.5 List IT assumptions
Right now in the applications needed for the database is Python, Virtualenv, and Django to start off
in the code. Later on what's needed is the html/CSS/Javascript to create the website to make it
interactive for the user.

##### Description of what was accomplished

In this sprint I was responsible for testing what we have implemented so far and ensuring that security measures were being taken in all aspects of our application. 

##### 5.1 Test packer/vagrant build

I tested the vagrant/packer build with no issues. 

![Vagrant Test](https://github.com/illinoistech-itm/2020-team10f/blob/master/images/vagranttest.PNG?raw=true)

##### 5.2 Test Login Fucntionality/Test UI

Login functionality and UI haven't been implemented yet. 

##### 5.3 Set up virtual environment 

I added files for our virtual environment that will make development more efficient. The virtual environment can be started from the root project folder using these commands:

'''
source env/Scripts/activate
python code/fakebtchapp/manage.py runserver
'''

Then, the webapp can be accessed at https://127.0.0.1:8000/. The environment can be closed from any location with 

'''
deactivate
'''

The only thing left to do to get a webpage running is to set up URL paths in our django-generated .py files to any associated views.

##### 5.4 List bugs/issues found

In testing the vagrant build and doing what I could when setting up a virtual environment to work with I found no issues to be addressed yet. 

##### 5.5 List Development and Security Assumptions

It's import that we are paying attention to security measures as we implent the login functionality and the UI in the next sprint.
