##### 2.5 Create UI/UX assumptions list

###### Main UI/UX assumptions
- UI/UX follows [Material Design Guidelines by Adobe](https://material.io/design/guidelines-overview/#).
- UI/UX built on the [Django framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/).
- UI/UX web elements built with standards-compliant [HTML5](https://validator.w3.org/), [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), and [JavaScript](https://codebeautify.org/jsvalidate).
- UI/UX follows Mobile-first development principle.
- UI/UX will be the same for all platforms (Windows, iOS, android)
- UI/UX will work as a Univeral Web App on mobile devices.
- UI/UX wireframe will be made in Adobe XD.
- UI/UX follows [common HCI guideliens](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/human_computer_interface/guidelines_in_hci.htm).

###### Color Palette assumptions

- Used the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/customization/color/) tool to create the Color Palette. 
- Used [Material Design Palette Generator](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors) to calculate additional colors.

###### Logo Color Palette assumptions
- Based off [Instagram's UX/UI Color Pallette Guidelines](https://en.instagram-brand.com/).
- [Instagram's official color palette](https://brandpalettes.com/instagram-color-codes/).

###### Font assumptions  
- Uses Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Oswald, and sans-serif in that order. (Material Design Guidelines)
- Follows [Material design type scale](https://material.io/design/typography/the-type-system.html#type-scale). (Material Design Guidelines)

###### Logo assumptions
- Brand mascot is the FakeBitch Badger
- Got helpful tips from [Twitter's Guidelines](https://about.twitter.com/en_us/company/brand-resources.html).

###### Usability Feature assumptions
- Follows [Material design Navigation Guidelines](https://material.io/design/navigation/understanding-navigation.html#types-of-navigation). (Material Design Guidelines)  
- Navigation is based on a flat hierarchy of 5 main pages. 
- Utilizes a Navigation drawer, Bottom navigation bar, and tabs.
- Support for Gestures will be added in a future sprint.
- Minimuim supported screen resolution is 512px.
- Maximum supported screen resolution is 1920px.

###### User Input assumptions
- Legal and illegal characters are defined in the chart above.
- All user inputs will be checked before sending to the server.
- A check will return true if all required inputs are filled and no illegal characters are found. It will return false if otherwise.
- If the check passes (returns true), then the input will be sent to the server.
- If the check fails (returns false), then the input will not be sent to the server. An error message will be displayed, and the illegal inputs will be highlighted.
- All user inputs (except for email and password) will be sanitized.
- User inputs will be sanitized twice; Once Server-side and once locally.
- Sanitized inputs are user inputs with their special characters removed.
- Special characters are the characters ^\w(?:\w*(?:[.-]\w+)?)*(?<=^.{4,32})$".
- Phone numbers dashes (-) are allowed because they will be removed during sanitation.
- Password requirements will follow [NIST 800-63 guidelines](https://securityboulevard.com/2019/03/nist-800-63-password-guidelines/)

##### Description of what was accomplished
What I have accomplished in the in this sprint is create an API structure diagram and API security structure
planning. Explaining the connection of the codes to Django and the how to create the API security in the app.
Also having user accounts with the help with Jeremy, which all the users have same passwords, Fakebitch10.

##### 3.3 Connecting the codes to Django
Django opens a connection to the database when it first makes a database query. It keeps the connection open and uses it in subsequent requests when neede. Which Django automatically opens the connection to the database.

##### 3.4 API Security in the App
API key is the application ID of a string. The usage of an API, the developer registers the application with the API service and receives a unique ID to use when making API requests. With each API call request, the client gives the API key within the HTTP request. API is the key part of the authorization and URLs are often logged, so if the API key is passed as a query , it it will show client logs and be seen by other applications with different keys, with different permission associated with thesekeys.

##### Description of what was accomplished
This sprint was spent focusing automation of our application. The packer and vagrant files were setup, and a test server was created for our applicatio0n to run off of. 

##### 4.1 List IT assumptions
Our server is going to run on Ubuntu for this aplication, so that is what Operating system was used for out packer and vagrant setup. A clean unaltered install of Ubuntu is currently in use, and wil be altered as we find need for it. 

##### 4.2 Add packer & vagrant template files to repo
The .json and .box files were added to our repo. The vagrantfile was altered for our specific box, and wil be changed as we find need for it. 

##### 4.3 Get packer & vagrant template working
Our box is ready to be launched by vagrant and connected to by our team.

##### 5.4 Data at Rest Protection
Implementing token authentication is much less resource intensive than traditionally encrypted data. Tokenization is much more manageable considering the amount of data we'd be processing upon deployment. Django REST framework offers a simple token authentication scheme already, details of which are available [here](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/#tokenauthentication).

##### 5.5 HTTPS/TLS
Using tokens in authentication requires us to make our API available only over HTTPS. 
To deploy our site behind HTTPS, we'll need a TLS certificate which we can obtain for free from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). After obtaining a certificate, we configure our server to use HTTPS and redirect traffic from HTTP.
