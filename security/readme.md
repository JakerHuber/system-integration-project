## Security Assumptions

In the tables, the first column is the item name which is divided into two parts. It states which security area is focused in technical or non-technical security. The second column is the general description for the item name. The last column is the status on whether the proposed security element has been adopted from our project in elements either reused or new. In this purpose exclusively is new implementations in our project.

## Risk Process

Doing a risk process is to determine the nature risks that could happened to the organizations. With the process we can see what types of risks we should identify as a team and type of assements should we prepare in the near future.
