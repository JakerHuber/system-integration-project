##### Description of what was accomplished
This sprint focused on getting the login functionality of the site up and running. The site now allows for user creation and access.

##### 2.1 Code Usable UI
The login feature of the site was successfully implemeted. Users can create an account, and admin accounts can be generated. 

##### 2.2 Test UI usability
The images below show the process of creating a user and logging into the homepage of the site.

##### 2.3 Aid in Django Skeleton Setup
The Django skeleton from last sprint was built upon in order to allow for the login functionality. Various scripts were implemented in order to get it up and running. This included adding scripts to manage authentication, user storage, and site redirects, among others. 

##### 2.4 Admin UI
An admin account was created for each of us on the site. Right now admins are able to manage other user accounts on the site. 

##### 2.5 List Bugs/Issues
As of now we have run into no issues with the functions that we implemented this sprint. The login, and creation of the virtual environment all worked successfully.

##### Description of what was accomplished
For this sprint, my main job was to get the automation finished. I worked on automating the deployment with packer and vagrant. I also automated the web app deployment inside vagrant. Our app now will automatically pull our repo and deploy our app securely.

##### 3.1 Updated .gitignore
I updated the .gitignore file. I did this because the new vagrant/packer features were causing a lot of extra files to be uploaded. This file will now ensure that only files we want are uploaded to the repo.

<p align="center"><a href=""><img src="/images/reports_sprint5_sr_dev_task_1.png" alt="" height=auto width=auto></a></p>

##### 3.2 Automated vagrant / updated build file
I updated the vagrant build file. This file will now fully automate the construction of our vagrant box. This means that all of the features we needed are done automatically. Features that were automated include vm networking,
configuration scripts, pulling of the team GitHub, and environment construction. This file is also the foundation that connects to other configuration files.

<p align="center"><a href=""><img src="/images/reports_sprint5_sr_dev_task_2.png" alt="" height=auto width=auto></a></p>

##### 3.3 Automated pulling of our repo  
I added several scripts to the /packer/scripts directory that will allow our vagrant box to securely pull from our github repo. The most important file is our config script.
This can be found in the /packer/build/ubuntu18044-vanilla.json between lines 73 and 83.

<p align="center"><a href=""><img src="/images/reports_sprint5_sr_dev_task_3.png" alt="" height=auto width=auto></a></p>

##### 3.4 Automated app deployment with post_install script
I added a post install script to the /packer/scripts/ directory that will automate the deployment of our web app. The vagrant build file ubuntu18044-vanilla.json points to it. This script
will deploy the django web app inside our vagrant box. Then, the app will be accessible from the ip address 10.0.2.2.

<p align="center"><a href=""><img src="/images/reports_sprint5_sr_dev_task_4.png" alt="" height=auto width=auto></a></p>

##### 3.5 Updated database deployment and encryption
I checked on the deplyoment of the database. We use SQLite for our database. Our database is deployed in our /fakebtchapp directory. Further configurations are handled by the post_install script. Data is encrypted using a secret key. This is a weak form of security, but it will work for now.

##### 4.5 List IT assumptions
Right now in the applications needed for the database is Python, Virtualenv, and Django to start off
in the code. Later on what's needed is the html/CSS/Javascript to create the website to make it
interactive for the user.

##### 5.1 Test packer/vagrant build

I tested the vagrant/packer build with no issues. 

![Vagrant Test](https://github.com/illinoistech-itm/2020-team10f/blob/master/images/vagranttest.PNG?raw=true)

##### 5.2 Test Login Fucntionality/Test UI

Login functionality and running.

##### 5.3 Set up virtual environment 

I added files for our virtual environment that will make development more efficient. The virtual environment can be started from the root project folder using these commands:

'''
source env/Scripts/activate
python code/fakebtchapp/manage.py runserver
'''

Then, the webapp can be accessed at https://127.0.0.1:8000/. The environment can be closed from any location with 

'''
deactivate
'''

The only thing left to do to get a webpage running is to set up URL paths in our django-generated .py files to any associated views.

![virtualenv](https://github.com/illinoistech-itm/2020-team10f/blob/master/images/virtualenv.PNG?raw=true)


##### 5.4 List bugs/issues found

In testing the vagrant build and doing what I could when setting up a virtual environment to work with I found no issues to be addressed yet. 

##### 5.5 List Development and Security Assumptions

It's import that we are paying attention to security measures as we implent the login functionality and the UI in the next sprint.
